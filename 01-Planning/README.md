# 🧭 Active Directory Lab – Planning Phase

## 📘 Overview

The planning phase is crucial for establishing a structured and efficient Active Directory (AD) lab environment. This phase involves defining the lab's objectives, designing the network topology, selecting appropriate hardware and software, and outlining the implementation roadmap. Proper planning ensures that the lab setup aligns with learning goals and simulates real-world scenarios effectively.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Skill Development:** Gain hands-on experience with Active Directory services, including domain controllers, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy Objects (GPOs), and user management.
- **Testing Environment:** Create a safe space to test configurations, updates, and security policies without affecting production systems.
- **Scenario Simulation:** Replicate common enterprise environments to practice deployment, troubleshooting, and administrative tasks.

---

## 🗺️ Network Topology Design

- **Domain Structure:** Plan a single forest with one domain to reflect organizational hierarchy.
- **Organizational Units (OUs):** Design OUs based on departments or functions (e.g., IT, HR, Finance) to manage policies and permissions effectively.
- **Site Configuration:** When simulating multiple physical locations, define sites and associate subnets accordingly.
- **Trust Relationships:** Outline trust relationships between domains when multiple domains are planned.

  - Assign static IP addresses and configure hostnames.

3. **Active Directory Deployment**
  - Promote servers to domain controllers.
  - Configure DNS and DHCP services.

4. **Client Configuration**
  - Install Windows Client OS on designated VMs.
  - Join clients to the domain.

5. **Group Policy Implementation**
  - Create and link GPOs to OUs.
  - Test policy application on client machines.

6. **User and Group Management**
  - Create user accounts and security groups.
  - Assign permissions and test access controls.
