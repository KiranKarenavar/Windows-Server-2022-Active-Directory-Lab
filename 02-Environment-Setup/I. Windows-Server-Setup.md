# 🛠️ Windows Server 2022 Setup

In this stage, I installed and configured **Windows Server 2022** as the Domain Controller (DC) for my lab environment. The process included setting a static IP, changing the computer name, installing Active Directory Domain Services, and promoting the server to a DC.

- Created a new virtual machine in **VirtualBox** with the following specs:
  - 8 GB RAM
  - 2 CPUs
  - 50 GB virtual hard drive
- Mounted the **Windows Server 2022 ISO** and completed the installation.
