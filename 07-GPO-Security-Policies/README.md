# 🔐 GPO Security Policies

## 📘 Overview

This section of the Active Directory Lab focuses on implementing essential security policies through Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enhance the security posture of the domain environment. It encompasses configurations for password policies, account lockout mechanisms, and audit policies to ensure robust protection against unauthorized access and to maintain compliance with security best practices.

- Controlled desktop icons

#### 🪟 Start Menu Customization

These settings are configured under:  
  📂 `User Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Start Menu and Taskbar`
  
- Removed "Search the Internet" option
- Disabled user tracking

### 🔄 Windows Update Management

#### 📝 Description

Centralized patch management policies that enforce scheduled security updates, feature rollouts, and quality patches while maintaining operational stability through controlled deployment cycles. Configures automatic download/install schedules with enterprise-appropriate deferral periods to balance security responsiveness with business continuity requirements.

These settings are configured under:  
  📂 `Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update`
  
- Update deployment: Semi-Annual Channel
