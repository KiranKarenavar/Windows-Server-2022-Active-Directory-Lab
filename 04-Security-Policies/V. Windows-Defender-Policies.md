## 📌 3. Purpose and Justification

### 🛡️ Why These Settings?

- **Turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus** ensures the system is protected against malware and other threats.
- **Turn off real-time protection** provides immediate scanning of files and processes.
- **Join Microsoft MAPS** enhances threat detection with Microsoft's cloud-based security.
- **Send file samples when further analysis is required** allows Windows Defender to send suspicious files to Microsoft for analysis.
- **Scan Removable Drives**  ensures that when USB drives, external hard disks, and other removable storage are connected to the system, they are automatically scanned for malware before users can access their contents. This prevents malicious software from spreading through removable media, which is a common attack vector in environments where users frequently share files via external drives.
