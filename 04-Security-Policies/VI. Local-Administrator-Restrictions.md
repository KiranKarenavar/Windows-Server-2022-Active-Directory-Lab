## ⚙️ 2. Policy Settings

Configured under:<br />
  📂 `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Restricted Groups`

| Setting                                                       | Value                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Administrators**                                            | Domain Admins, Local Admins |
| **Deny Local Administrators from Remotely Accessing Systems** | Enabled                     |

These settings restrict local administrators from accessing systems remotely and enforce the use of domain-based administrative rights.
