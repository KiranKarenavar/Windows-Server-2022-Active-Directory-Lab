## ⚙️ 2. Policy Settings

Configured in:<br />
  📂 `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policies > Account Lockout Policy`

| Setting                                     | Value         |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Account lockout duration**                | 30 minutes    |
| **Account lockout threshold**               | 5 attempts    |
| **Allow Administrator account lockout**     | Disabled      |
| **Reset account lockout counter after**     | 10 minutes    |

These settings ensure that accounts are temporarily disabled after five failed logon attempts, making it more difficult for attackers to guess passwords.
