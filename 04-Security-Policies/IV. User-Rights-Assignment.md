## ⚙️ 2. Policy Settings

The following settings were configured under:<br />
    📂 `Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment`

| Setting                                                            | Value                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Allow Log on locally**                                           | Administrators, Domain Users    |
| **Allow Log on through Remote Desktop Services**                   | Administrators, Domain Users    |
| **Log on as a service**                                            | Local Service, Network Service  |
| **Log on as a batch job**                                          | Administrators, Backup Admins   |
| **Shut down the system**                                           | Administrators                  |

These rights control the ability of users or groups to log on to the system, run services, and perform administrative tasks like shutting down the computer.

## 📌 3. Purpose and Justification

### 🛡️ Why These Settings?

- **Log on locally** allows users to log into the local machine.
- **Log on as a service** grants specific system accounts the ability to run services.
- **Log on as a batch job** allows the user to execute batch scripts.
- **Shut down the system** restricts this action to administrators to avoid unintentional shutdowns by non-privileged users.

## ✅ 4. Testing and Validation

- Tested by attempting to log in with different user accounts to validate the policy application.
- Verified user rights using:

```powershell
gpresult /r
```
