## 🛡️ 3. Purpose and Justification

Audit policies provide visibility into actions that may indicate unauthorized behavior. These logs are essential for:

- **Compliance** with standards like ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, and CIS Controls.
- **Forensics** in the event of an incident or breach.
- **Alerting** through SIEM tools or manual log reviews.

By auditing both successful and failed events, I ensured I could track both normal user activity and suspicious behavior.

## 🔎 4. Testing and Verification

- Performed logon attempts, privilege use, and file access actions.

- Opened **Event Viewer** on the domain controller:<br />
  📂 `Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Security`
  
- Verified audit entries matched the expected activities.
