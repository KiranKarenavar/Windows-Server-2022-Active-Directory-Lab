## ⚠️ Common Issues and Resolutions

### 🙅 1. Group Policy Not Applying

**Symptoms:**
* Group Policy Objects (GPOs) not applying to users or computers.
* Settings not reflecting as expected on client machines.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

- **Verify GPO Linkage and Scope:**
  - Ensure the GPO is linked to the correct Organizational Unit (OU).
  - Confirm that the user or computer object resides in the OU where the GPO is applied.
  - Check security filtering and WMI filtering settings.

- **Use `gpresult` or Group Policy Results Wizard:**
  - Run `gpresult /h gpresult.html` on the client machine to generate a report.
  - Analyze the report for any errors or denied GPOs.

- **Check Event Viewer Logs:**
- Navigate to:<br />
     📂 `Event Viewer > Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > GroupPolicy > Operational`
- Look for warning or error events related to Group Policy processing.

### 📇 2. Active Directory Replication Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Inconsistent directory information across domain controllers.
- Errors during replication attempts.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

- **Use `repadmin` Tool:**
  - Run `repadmin /replsummary` to get a summary of replication status.
  - Use `repadmin /showrepl` to view detailed replication information.
  
- **Check DNS Configuration:**
  - Ensure all domain controllers can resolve each other's Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs).
  - Verify that the correct DNS records exist for each domain controller.

- **Monitor Event Logs:**
  - Look for replication-related errors in the `Directory Service` event log.

## 👥 3. User Account Lockouts

**Symptoms:**
- Users are unable to log in due to account lockouts.
- Frequent lockout events in the security logs.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

- **Identify the Source of Lockouts:**
  - Use the `Account Lockout and Management Tools` to trace the source.
  - Analyze the `Security` event logs for Event ID 4740.
  
- **Check for Cached Credentials:**
  - Ensure that users are not using outdated credentials on other devices or services.

- **Review Account Lockout Policies:**
  -  Navigate to:<br />
     📂 `Group Policy Management > Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policies > Account Lockout Policy`
  - Adjust thresholds as necessary.

## 🎛 4. DNS Configuration Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Domain controllers unable to locate each other.
- Clients experiencing name resolution failures.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

- **Verify DNS Settings:**
  - Ensure that all domain controllers and clients are pointing to the correct internal DNS servers.

- **Check for Missing or Incorrect DNS Records:**
  - Use `nslookup` to verify SRV and A records for domain controllers.

- **Clear DNS Cache:**
  - Run `ipconfig /flushdns` to clear the DNS resolver cache on clients.
